<p id="a"> 
					Each equivalence relation provides a partition of the underlying set into disjoint equivalence classes. Two elements of the given set are equivalent to each other, if and only if they belong to the same equivalence class.
</p>
<div id="1"> 
<h3 id="b">Definition:</h3>
<p id="c"> 
					A binary relation ~ on a set X is said to be an equivalence relation, if and only if it is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. That is, for all a , b , and c in the X:
</p>
<ul>
					<li>a ~ a.(Reflexivity) </li>
					<li>a ~ b if and only if b ~ a.(Symmetry) </li>
					<li>If a ~ band b ~ c then a ~ c.(Transitivity) </li></ul>
					<p id="c">X together with the relations ~ is called as the a setoid.The equivalence class of a under ~,denoted [a], is defined as [a]={x âˆˆ X : x ~ a}.</p>
<h3 id="a">Examples:</h3>
<ul>
					<li>"Is equal to" on the set of numbers. For example, 1/2 is equals to 4/8 and so on.
"Has the same birthday as" on the set of all people.</li>
<li> "Has the same birthday as" on the set of all people.</li>
<li>"Is similar to" on the set of all triangles.</li>
<li>"Is congruent to" on the set of all triangles.</li>
<li>"Is congruent to, modulo n", on the integers.</li>
<li>"Has the same image under a function" on the elements of the domain of the function.</li>
<li>"Has the same absolute value" on the set of real numbers.</li>
<li>"Has the same cosine" on the set of all angles and so on.</li>
</ul>

<div id="2"> 
<h3 id="b">Equivalence Class:</h3>
<p id="c">
					A subset Y of X such that a ~ b holds for all a and b in Y, and never for a in Y and b outside Y, is called an equivalence class of X by ~. Let [a]= {x âˆˆ X : a ~ x } denote the equivalence class to which a belongs. All elements of X equivalent to each other are also elements of the same equivalence class.
</p>
</div>
<div id="3"> 
	<h3 id="b">Quotient Set:</h3>
	<p id="c">
	The set of all equivalence classes of X by ~, denoted X/~= {[x] : x âˆˆ X} is the quotient set of X by ~. If X is a topological space, there is a natural way of transforming X/~ into a topological space; see quotient space for the details.					
	</p>		
</div>
<div id="4">
	<h3 id="b">Partitions:</h3>
<p id="c"	>A partition of X is a set P of nonempty subsets of X, such that every element of X is an element of a single element of P. Each element of P is a cell of the partition. Moreover, the elements of P are pairwise disjoint and their union is X.</p>
</div>
<div id="5">
	<h3 id="b">Fundamental Theorem of the Equivalence Relations:</h3>
	<p id="c">
	A key result links equivalence relations and partitions:</p>
<ul> 
<li> "An equivalence relation ~ on a set X partitions X.</li>
<li>Conversely, corresponding to any partition of X, there exists an equivalence relation ~ on X."</li>
</ul>
<p id="c">In both cases, the cells of the partition of X are the equivalence classes of X by ~. Since each element of X belongs to a unique cell of any partition of X, and since each cell of the partition is identical to an equivalence class of X by ~, each element of X belongs to a unique equivalence class of X by ~ . Thus there is a natural bijection between the set of all equivalence relations on X and the set of all partitions of X.					
	</p>
</div>
<div id="6">
	<h3 id="b">Comparing Equivalence Relations:	</h3>
	<p id="c">
		If ~ and â‰ˆ are two equivalence relations on the same set S, and a ~ b implies aâ‰ˆb for all a,b âˆˆ S, then â‰ˆ is said to be a coarser relation than ~, and ~ is a finer relation than â‰ˆ. Equivalently,
<ul> 
<li> ~ is finer than â‰ˆ if every equivalence class of ~ is a subset of an equivalence class of â‰ˆ, and thus every equivalence class of â‰ˆ is a union of equivalence classes of ~.</li>
<li>~ is finer than â‰ˆ if the partition created by ~ is a refinement of the partition created by â‰ˆ.</li>
</ul> </p>
<p id="c">The equality equivalence relation is the finest equivalence relation on any set, while the universal relation, which relates all pairs of elements, is the coarsest. The relation "~ is finer than â‰ˆ" on the collection of all equivalence relations on a fixed set is itself a partial order relation, which makes the collection a geometric lattice.
